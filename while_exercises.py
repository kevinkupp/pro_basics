    Ask user age.

    You have to ask the user his/her age using input("What is your age?").
    You have to repeat this process until a correct age is entered.
    The age is correct if:
    - it is numeric (answering "a" is not correct)
    - it is greater or equal to the age_limit
    - it is less or equal to 100

    So, if the user enters a wrong age, the user gets a warning.
    The question is repeated until a correct age is entered.
    The function returns the correct age as int.

    Warning is printed out:
    - non numberic input: Wrong input!
    - age < age_limit: Too young!
    - age > 100: Too old!

    What is your age? 10
